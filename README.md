## 📂 Hosted Projects

### 🔍🤖 awesome-git-commit

[https://github.com/bitse-lab/awesome-git-commit](https://github.com/bitse-lab/awesome-git-commit)

**Evaluating Generated Commit Messages with Large Language Models**

This project investigates the problem of **automated evaluation of generated commit messages**. Traditional reference-based metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR exhibit significant limitations in this task due to the non one-to-one mapping between code changes and commit messages.

We systematically explore:

* Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators
* Prompting strategies including Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought reasoning
* Evaluation robustness, fairness, and reproducibility

Our results show that LLM-based evaluators can achieve **near-human-level evaluation quality**, significantly outperforming conventional automatic metrics.

### ✨ conventional-commit-classification

[https://github.com/bitse-lab/conventional-commit-classification](https://github.com/bitse-lab/conventional-commit-classification)

**A First Look at Conventional Commits Classification**

This repository presents an empirical study on the **Conventional Commits Specification (CCS)** and its adoption in open-source projects.

Key contributions include:

* An empirical analysis of CCS usage in real-world repositories
* Identification of common misclassification patterns
* A refined and less overlapping definition set for commit types
* An automated approach for conventional commit classification

📦 The repository contains all datasets, models, and experimental code used in the study.
